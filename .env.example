# An Ethereum RPC node is required to run the tests. You can use an Alchemy RPC node or a local node:
# Create an Alchemy API key: https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide
# Or even better, run a local node: https://ethereum.org/en/run-a-node and use it's RPC URL.

#   - QuickNode (free trial available): https://your-endpoint.base.quiknode.pro/<your-key>/

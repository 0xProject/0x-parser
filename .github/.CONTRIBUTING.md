# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Please review this guide prior to submitting a pull request.

## Development

Start by [forking](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and cloning the repository onto your computer. Afterwards, you can start development by installing the dependencies and running the tests.

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Run tests

```
npm test
```

Once you have completed your changes, you can create a [pull request from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork). Project maintainers may create pull requests in the repository without a fork.

## Pull requests

For large or impactful change, please open an [issue](https://github.com/hzhu/eth-balances/issues/new) or [discussion](https://github.com/hzhu/eth-balances/discussions/new?category=q-a) prior to submitting a pull request. This allows the project maintainers and contributors to discuss alternatives and solutions prior to implementation.

### Workflow

1. Open an issue
1. Fork the repo and create a branch
1. Add new commits
   1. Commits should be [concise, descriptive, and well formatted](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules)
   1. Commits should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification and use the [standard headings](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/cb0f936e598c5bfb8d3e0a9c0eeb57ae59a35140/src/changelog-notes.ts#L43-L54)
   1. This repo has a linear git history and merge commits are not allowed
1. Open a new pull request on GitHub
   1. [Link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) the issue you created earlier with the pull request

### Dependabot

This repository uses [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to help [secure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates) and [update](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates#about-version-updates-for-dependencies) project dependencies. It does this by automatically opening pull requests to update package dependencies. Project maintainers are responsible for reviewing, testing, approving, and merging Dependabot pull requests.

## Release

Project maintainers can publish releases. Releases are automated with Google's [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) GitHub action. Simply merge the release pull request ([release PR](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please#whats-a-release-pr)) to publish a release ðŸš€.

The GitHub action parses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to help automate releases. It creates a release PR that is kept up-to-date as additional commits are merged. The release PR can be merged once maintainers are ready to publish the release. Merging the release PR triggers the action to:

1. Update the `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json`
2. Tag the commit with the [version](https://semver.org/)
3. Create a GitHub release based on the tag
4. Publish [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x/0x-parser) to npm

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) and the release tooling automatically parses the semantic version based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! Before you submit a pull request, we kindly ask you to review this guide thoroughly.

## Development

First, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and clone the repository onto your local machine. Once you have your local copy of the repository, you can commence with development. This typically involves installing the required dependencies and executing the tests.

### Install Dependencies

After cloning the repository, navigate to its root directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Run the Tests

Features and bug fixes must be accompanied by tests, as this library aims to maintain 100% test coverage ðŸ§ª. Focus on testing only the public interfaces; avoid testing implementation details. To run the tests, you'll need a URL to an Ethereum RPC node. The easiest way to obtain one is by [creating](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide) an API key through Alchemy. After obtaining the key, follow the instructions in the `.env.example` file to get started.

Run the tests by running the following command:

```
npm test
```

Once you have made your changes and verified they work correctly, you can submit a [pull request from your forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

## Pull Requests

Before proposing changes, please open an [issue](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-parser/issues/new) or [discussion](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-parser/discussions/new/choose) for collaborative decision-making on solutions prior to submitting a pull request. This enhances the effectiveness of your contributions and promotes collective input.

### Workflow

1. **Open an [issue](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-parser/issues/new)**: Start by opening an issue detailing the problem you want to solve or the feature you want to add.
1. **Fork and branch:** Fork the repository and create a new branch on your fork to work on the changes.
1. **Add commits:** Add new commits to your branch. Remember:
   1. Commits should be [concise, descriptive, and well formatted](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/#seven-rules).
   1. Commits should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) specification and use the [standard headings](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/cb0f936e598c5bfb8d3e0a9c0eeb57ae59a35140/src/changelog-notes.ts#L43-L54).
   1. This repository maintains a linear git history, so merge commits are not allowed.
1. **Open a pull request:** Open a [new pull request](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-parser/compare) on GitHub, and [link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) it to the issue you created in the first step.

### Dependabot

This repository employs [Dependabot ðŸ¤–](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to [secure](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates) and [update](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuring-dependabot-version-updates#about-version-updates-for-dependencies) project dependencies by automatically initiating pull requests for package upgrades. The duty of project maintainers is to review, test, approve, and merge these Dependabot-generated pull requests.

## Release

Project maintainers are entrusted with the task of publishing new releases. Releases are automated with Google's [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) GitHub action. Simply put, to publish a release, you simply need to merge the release pull request (PR) ðŸš€.

The release-please GitHub action parses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0) to help automate the release process. It automatically generates a release PR, which is continuously updated as new commits are merged into the main branch. Once maintainers decide that it's time to publish a new release, they can merge the release PR.

Upon merging the release PR, the GitHub action initiates a series of tasks:

1. Updates the `CHANGELOG.md` and `package.json` files.
1. Tags the commit associated with the release with the [version](https://semver.org) number.
1. Creates a new GitHub release based on this tag.
1. Publishes a new version of [the package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x/0x-parser) to npm.

## Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) and the release tooling automatically parses the semantic version based on the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0).

# Overview

This is a demonstration of using [0x-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@0x/0x-parser) directly in a web page, without a UI library or framework. This example should remain minimal for clarity.

## Getting Started

Run the development server in the root directory of this repository:

```bash
npm run web:example
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You should observe some logs showing swap details of a 0x transaction.
